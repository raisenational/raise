Whether you're a JCR president who has a great idea for reaching out to your students, or a Senior Tutor wanting to encourage social responsibility, we'd love you to join us in changing the way students think about charity. Contact us at <a href="mailto:sponsorship.mwa@gmail.com" className="text-blue-300">sponsorship.mwa@gmail.com</a> or via the form below and we'd love to meet with you to discuss how we can work together.</>}

You can do this by offering to match the donations of your college members (perhaps with a financial cap). We'd also be keen to work with you to publicise MWA to your students. That could be via college, alumni or May Ball mailing lists, through your JCR, or by supporting the work of the college reps at your college."

Plus, if you have a beautiful lawn with capacity for 600 guests or more, and you want to put your college at the centre of the MWA Summer Party, why not enquire about hosting our event?"

        We love what the May Week Alternative team are building, and we're thrilled to be able to support them. The movement they've built in such a short time is inspiring - it's fantastic to be a part of growing it for the future!
