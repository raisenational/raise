            <p>
              Reps are a central part of Raise’s community and are crucial to the
              growth of the movement. As a rep, you have the opportunity to help

              about Raise with others in your college, departments, and social
              groups - the ask is significant and requires some thought, so this
              is how most people come to join.

          <FAQ title="£150 is a lot of money - what if I can't donate that?">
            <p>
              We recognise that £150 is a large amount of money for many students,
              and whilst we have thought carefully about recommending this amount
              (see next question), it is important to us that any student feels
              able to join us in celebrating through giving.
            </p>
            <p>
              As such, whilst we recommend £150, you are welcome to join Raise by
              making a donation of a size which is significant to you and allows
              you to put charity at the heart of your end-of-year celebrations. It
              is central to our philosophy (see
              {' '}
              <a href="./#our-philosophy">here</a>
              {' '}
              for more) that students
              actively engage with their decision to celebrate through giving, but
              we recognise that the donation that enables this will not be the
              same for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, you have the option of donating in weekly installments,
              as some have found this more manageable. A weekly donation of £5
              from the donations launch up until our summer celebration adds up to
              about £150, which will still be doubled through our matched funding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: We have ensured that our donations page allows you to hide
              your name and/or donation amount, should you choose.
            </p>
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ title="Why do you recommend £150?">
            <p>
              We recognise that £150 is a large amount of money, and substantially
              more than most students would routinely donate to charity (indeed,
              that is part of the point!). There are a couple of key reasons we
              recommend this figure:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Encouraging considered giving:</b>
              {' '}
              Raise is all about changing
              the way students think about charity, and we can only achieve this
              if students engage consciously with the act of donating. By inviting
              students to give an amount that’s personally significant to them, we
              hope that all donors will stop and think meaningfully about their
              decision to donate, and will in turn take this positive, deliberate
              approach towards giving forward into their future lives. This is why
              we recommend £150, or a donation of any size significant to the
              donor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Impact:</b>
              {' '}
              Crucially, the recommended amount, coupled with
              matched funding, allows us to have an exceptionally large impact for
              a student charity initiative; your £150 donation, when doubled, can
              help protect over 350 people from malaria.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Ball Symbolism:</b>
              {' '}
              The £150 figure is representative of the cost
              of many ball tickets - this is symbolic of our belief that charity
              can be embraced as an integral part of Trinity celebrations, on a
              par with balls.
            </p>
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ title="I'm already going to a ball. Is Raise really for me? (Hint: yes, definitely!)">
            <p>
              Of course, Raise is for everyone - whether you're going to three
              balls or none, we welcome you to join our growing community and put
              charity at the heart of your celebrations. Raise is an alternative
              way to celebrate, but that doesn't mean you can't take part in other
              things going on!
            </p>
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ title="Can I donate to a different charity?">
            <p>
              At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend
              (see below), particularly given how much money students are
              donating. However, we recognise that some students may want to join
              us in celebrating through giving, but would prefer to donate to a
              different charity. This is absolutely fine, but please get in touch
              with us beforehand so that we are aware.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: All matched funding will still go to the Against Malaria
              Foundation.

          <FAQ title="Why do you recommend donating to AMF?">
            <p>
              At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend.
              When students are making such significant donations, we want to make
              sure the money is doing as much good as it possibly can. To make our
              decision, we have taken the advice of independent charity evaluators
              {' '}
              <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">
                GiveWell

              <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>
              , which both rank AMF as one of the most effective charities in the
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tragically, malaria causes 400,000 preventable deaths every year,
              disproportionately affecting young children and pregnant women, and
              has a knock-on effect on the local economy. AMF works with local
              partners to provide life-saving bed-nets which protect people as
              they sleep. To find out more about their work, see
              {' '}
              <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">AMF's website</a>
              . The
              specific net distributions for which we have funded nets can be seen
              on
              {' '}

              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Because AMF's intervention is so effective at preventing malaria,
              each donation can have a huge impact. For example, a donation of
              £150, doubled through matched funding, can help protect 350 people.
              In fact, the money we raised nationally in 2023 was enough to
              protect almost 95,000 people!

          <FAQ title="What makes Raise different to a charity ball?">
            <p>
              At Raise, our mission is to encourage students to adopt a positive,
              deliberate approach towards giving. As such, we focus on ensuring
              that each student who chooses to join can engage meaningfully with
              the impact of their donation. The primary role of the Summer Party
              is to facilitate this engagement, as an enjoyable opportunity to
              come together as a community and celebrate our collective impact.
              However, it is not the most important element of what we do, nor the
              purpose of donating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crucially, the donation students make to join Raise does not
              constitute ‘buying a ticket’ to the party. Indeed, the funding of
              our summer celebration is completely separate to the donation (it’s
              funded through a combination of additional voluntary contributions
              from donors and external sponsorship). Many students have joined
              Raise without attending the Summer Party at all.
            </p>
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ title="If 100% of donations go to charity, how do you put on the summer celebration? What's it like?">
            <p>
              The Summer Party is a chance for us to come together and celebrate
              our collective impact, as well as the end of the academic year.
              Crucially, 100% of the money students donate goes directly to
              charity – none of it is used to fund the party. As such, we invite
              students to make an optional contribution of £10 per head, separate
              to their donation, to cover the costs of the event (which are
              generously subsidised by our sponsors). Importantly, everyone will
              be very welcome to join, whether or not they feel able to make this
              contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be music, food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and
              live entertainment, contributing to the atmosphere of celebration
              you’ll experience with the rest of the Raise community. It’s a
              fantastic chance to reflect on the impact of our donations and many
              of those who’ve attended elsewhere in recent years have described it
              as a real highlight!

          <FAQ title="What about COVID-19?">
            <p>
              Naturally, we are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the
              ways in which we can come together over the course of this year, and
              we are keeping a close eye on the local and national guidance at
              every stage. However, even if we are not able to come together as an
              entire community, this will not stop us from marking the end of the
              year in true Raise style. Whether in smaller groups or all together,
              we aim to create a meaningful and enjoyable format to bring the
              community together and celebrate our collective impact under these
              different circumstances.
