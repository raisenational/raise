				<p>Raise educates students about charitable giving, aiming to encourage effective and deliberate giving. Itâ€™s run by unpaid volunteers and does not make a profit.</p>
				<p>We call each local Raise group a chapter. These tend to be based at universities, where they may be societies. Each chapter is run by a team of student volunteers, recruited annually.</p>
				<p>These chapters are supported by a central, national team. The national team recruits, mentors, and coordinates the chapters, sets the strategic direction for what Raise does, and provides support services like the website.</p>
				<p>The national team is supported by an advisory board, a group of current and former students who have been closely involved with Raise in the past. They provide strategic support and work on exciting new projects such as the Raise blog.</p>
